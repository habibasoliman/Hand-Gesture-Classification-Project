I evaluated six different machine learning models to build the classifier:
1:XGBoost
2: Logistic Regression
3: Gradient Boosting
4: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6: Random Forest
 After testing and fine-tuning, XGBoost stood out as the most promising model, achieving an impressive 98.3% accuracy
